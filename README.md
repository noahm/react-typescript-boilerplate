# React + Typescript Boilerplate

## Setup
If you don't already have node 9 and npm 5 installed, square that away first.
If you don't have yarn installed, `npm install -g yarn`

Clone this repo, and install its dependencies:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:noahm/react-typescript-boilerplate.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project
yarn
```

## Dev
This is my own little sandbox starting point, configured to have the
option of building an app usable offline.

Use `yarn start` to have a live dev server.

Use `yarn build` to delete the previous build and dump a built
index.html + app.js + resource files into the build folder.

Use `yarn run clean` to delete the build folder.
